- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RSAMRG-SHU
- We are an intelligent sensing and manipulation lab in the School of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University directed by Professor Yangmin Xie. Our work consists of 3D environmental modeling and perception with unmanned systems, path planning and strategizing of autonomous vehicles and control techniques for multi-DOF rigid and soft manipulators.
    Sensing is the way for a 'robot' to know the world, and manipulation is the way for it to change the world. By combining the techniques in the two aspects, we hope to contribute in enabling the robots to explore autonomously, inspect and work in complex environments. Please visit our research page to learn more about the work we do.
  
- We interest field are:
- 1) Multi-sensor fusion
- 2) Recognition and Position
- 3) Path Planning
- 4) Autonomous Exploration
- 5) Manipulation and Control
